# Titanic Machine Learning
I use the standard [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to practice using a classifier.

## Repository Components
[`titanic.ipynb`](https://github.com/pvasudev16/titanic/blob/main/titanic.ipynb)  explores and analyzes the data, and applies machine learning algorithms.

## Visualizations
For every variable in the data set, there are visualizations. For the Age feature:

![Distribution of Passengers's Age](https://github.com/pvasudev16/titanic/blob/main/passenger_age_histogram.png)
![Distribution of Passengers's Age Based on Survival](https://github.com/pvasudev16/titanic/blob/main/passenger_age_survived_did_not_survive.png)

## Machine Learning
In the [notebook](https://github.com/pvasudev16/titanic/blob/main/titanic.ipynb), I use a Random Forest Classifier and a K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier, adjusting which features I use. My best model
scores 78.95% accuracy on the test data set.

## Useful Links
[Encyclopedia Titanica](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/explorer/) has information about the passengers, which is useful for data imputation, as well as just interesting for Titanic information.
[Jonkheer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonkheer) is a title for the nobility, which I learned in this project.
