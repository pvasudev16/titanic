# Titanic Machine Learning
All aboard the Titanic... will you be one of the lucky ones that survives? In this machine learning exercise, I intend to find out. I'm using the standard [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to practice using a classifier.

This notebook is organized as follows:
- Preliminary Data Analysis
- Further Data Cleaning
    - Age
    - Port of Embarkment
    - Cabin
- Further Data Analysis
